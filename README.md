all the functions that discord audit log already has but with the bonus of being able to show contents of a deleted message instead of just showing that a message was deleted

in order to use, create a channel called "audit-log" (limiting who can view it isnt neccesary but reccomended) and ensure that the bot has all the permisions. if there is no audit-log channel, the bot will create one.
